The &lt;a href=&quot;https://indico.cern.ch/event/809820/overview&quot;&gt;event&lt;/a&gt;
drew more than 100 participants including experimental physicists, theoretical physicists, computer scientists, and applied mathematicians. IRIS-HEP members Kyle Cranmer and Sebastian Macaluso were the local organizers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jets are sprays of particles that result from the production of quarks and gluons, and they are copiously produced at the LHC. Essentially every collision at the LHC has one or more jets. Many searches for new physics must either fight against
a huge background caused by jets or try to uncover the subtle signs for new physics hiding inside the jets. Because jets are composed of many particles, they are complicated objects to analyze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Machine learning techniques offer &lt;a href=&quot;https://iris-hep.org/projects/ml4jets.html&quot;&gt;great promise for jet physics&lt;/a&gt;,
which has become one of the most active areas for deep learning research at the LHC. Initial work in deep learning for jet physics was based on an analogy with images. Later, techniques built on an analogy with natural language. Shortly after that graph neural
networks were brought to bear on these challenging problems. The particular considerations of jet physics have motivated a variety of new architectures, and these challenges have inspired a number of collaborations with machine learning researchers. Several
of these approaches were compared in the paper &lt;a href=&quot;http://inspirehep.net/record/1722059&quot;&gt;The Machine Learning Landscape of Top Taggers&lt;/a&gt;,
which considered a specific benchmark dataset. On Friday, Heiko Mueller and Sebastian Macaluso (of the NSF-funded projects IRIS-HEP, DIANA-HEP, and SCAILFIN) presented a tool called ROB (Reproducible Open Benchmarks) aimed at streamlining and automating these
types of benchmarking efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This year we have really seen an growth in the scope of topics being discussed at ML4Jets,” explained Kyle Cranmer. Generative models such as GANs were a hot topic. In addition, we heard from both physicists and mathematicians about Optimal Transport,
which provides a natural way of comaring how similar two jets are. Connections were made to topic modelling, hierarchical clustering, variational inference, likelihood-free inference, domain adaptation, unfolding, and robustness. In addition, an entire session
was devoted to a challenge dubbed the LHC Olympics, which focused on anomaly detection. A number of techniques have beeen developed recently to try to uncover new physics from the data. This is a fresh approach to the LHC data analysis that complements the

&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As explained by workshop co-organizer Mark Neubauer, a Professor of Physics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, “In high-energy physics research at colliders like the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), experiments need to separate, often in real-time, very rare signals of interest from a large rate of more mundane proton-proton interactions observed in the detectors. Machine learning is rapidly becoming a powerful tool to achieve this challenging goal. This workshop brought together experts from domain science (High Energy Physics and beyond), computer science and industry to discuss the latest advances in accelerated machine learning and inference. The strong turn-out for the workshop and lively discussions by the participants showcased the vitality of this research thrust and its potential to significantly advance the discovery potential in fundamental physics.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FastML workshop brings together researchers interested not only in machine learning, but how it can be used on super-fast, accelerated technologies like FPGAs and GPUs. The workshop is exploring the landscape of possibilities that the combination of ML and such computer technologies will deliver in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isobel Ojalvo, Assistant Professor in Physics at Princeton University, attended the workshop because “FastML will be an important tool to help us collect high quality data and search for extraordinarily rare particles and phenomena that would allow us to understand the underlying forces in the universe.” 
In particular, Ojalvo is interested in writing algorithms that will be able to classify particle collisions at the LHC in less than a few microseconds for the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector. “FastML provides a mechanism to use our favorite Machine Learning techniques like Neural Networks and Boosted Decision Trees with a very short latency; similarly to ML inference on CPUs, we are able to take in a large amount of data from an LHC collision and decide whether or not this data is worth saving and analyzing further,” she explained. “By  running this inference on FPGAs  or other accelerated systems we can make these inferences in tens of nanoseconds instead of in milliseconds. The detectors at the LHC see 100s of billions of particles every second and this will only increase in the next 10 years as the LHC itself undergoes upgrades.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“ML is rapidly becoming the major tool to analyze complex data sets over many different disciplines. We saw the need to come together as HEP community and learn more about ultrafast on-detector inference and real-time systems, acceleration as-a-service, hardware platforms, coprocessor technologies (CPU/GPU/TPU/FPGAs), distributed learning, and hyper-parameter optimization.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Philip Harris, an Assistant Professor of Physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and also a workshop co-organizer, elaborated: “For this workshop, we wanted to bring together a number of experts on machine learning and processor technology to make it clear that there is a serious demand for high-speed machine learning and that there are potential solutions that already exist. The goal of this workshop was to make it clear that we can enable further development in both fields by integrating the physics community with the high-speed machine learning community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In a few years the demands to process data at the Large Hadron Collider will exceed the scaling limitations of Moore’s law (really Dennard Scaling). In my opinion, the fastest and most effective way to overcome this limit is to come up with approaches to parallelize algorithms so that we run these algorithms with modern processing technology. The most natural and effective way is through the adoption of Machine Learning. So I see this approach as a critical element to enabling high-quality research at the LHC. Many other HEP experiments, such as DUNE, will benefit from the same paradigm switch.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Philip continued: “My own physics research on understanding the Higgs boson and dark matter relies on data that we will likely not be able to store in the future running of the LHC if we do not alter our research paradigm towards parallelized computation.  However, if we do perform this switch and we get significant gains in our ability to process data, I see a potential enhancement of the physics quality output of my own projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;
Four instructors from ATLAS, two from Software Carpentries, and two from IRIS-HEP were involved, along with five helpers from ATLAS, providing a 4:1 student to instructor ratio to be maintained at all times with the 31 students. This five day training event taught four basic computing skills: version control, build systems, continuous integration/testing, and containers. Each morning session was followed up by an ATLAS specific lesson in the afternoon over that topic. For the final half-day, instructors proposed a set of topics and the students voted on them; the top three topics were then taught in parallel sessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feedback from the workshop was overwhelmingly positive. All 31 students completed both the preworkshop and postmortum surveys. The gender makeup was 63% male and 37% female. 90% were PhD students. In all areas, student self-identification of skill levels increased dramatically after the bootcamp. Before starting, well over half of the students did not know how to use CMake to build a C++ project; but after the bootcamp, over 90% identified as at least half way to an expert (and 0% identified as a beginner). Using Continuous integration for Analysis was even slightly better (due at least in part to a universally praised session on ATLAS CI by Giordon Stark), with containers and version control increases only slightly behind. Around 90% were interested or possibly interested in helping out at a similar event in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students had a great time and built connections to other ATLAS collaborators and with several IRIS-HEP members; everyone said they met at least four new collaboration members. Several social activities were planned, such as a pizza lunch, two dinners at a local restaurants, and a visit to the Berkeley Bowl; a nearby supermarket that has become a local favorite. A couple of hours one day were set aside for a career panel, where students heard from six people from careers after working on ATLAS or anther HEP experiment that live in the Bay area. 77% of the participants believed this was “Very Useful”, with 68% of the participants saying that their perspective on potential career paths after grad school were changed as a result of the panel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical
model building. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on
the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and
make decisions with minimal human intervention.  While many machine
learning algorithms have been around for a long time, the ability
to automatically apply complex mathematical calculations to big
data repeatedly and ever faster is a recent development. Learning
these skill would make it possible to quickly and automatically
produce models that can analyze bigger, more complex data and deliver
faster, more accurate results. The potential for using ML techniques 
encompasses all STEM fields. Learning ML tools early on can be
very useful in a number of career paths and thus there is a great demand
for opportunities such as this hackathon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diyaselis Delgado López, a UPRM physics undergraduate student who 
participated, was surprised and excited about what she learned: “Thanks to 
this experience, I definitely want to investigate further and use these 
techniques in everything I can.” Ricardo González, another physics undergrad 
at UPRM, also participated in the Hackathon. He felt that attending the 
Hackathon was extremely valuable “because it opened my eyes to a powerful tool 
that physicists have within our reach. Soon I will become a graduate student, 
and I am now looking for ways to incorporate what I have learned here.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hackathon &lt;a href=&quot;https://indico.cern.ch/event/809812/timetable/&quot;&gt;agenda&lt;/a&gt; 
included talks by UPRM researchers and faculty from the Mathematics, Physics
and CS&amp;amp;E departments. Topics included covered Statistics, ML
techniques and use cases from research activities at UPRM. &lt;a href=&quot;http://sergeigleyzer.com&quot;&gt;Dr. Sergei
Gleyzer&lt;/a&gt;, a physicist from University of Florida and convener of ML group at 
the CMS Experiment at CERN, also participated as a lecturer and facilitator. 
The participants were students from UPRM who were given challenging 
problem to solve during Hackathon.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">The very first Machine Learning Hackathon at the Physics Department of the University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez took place on 24-26 April, 2019, organized by IRIS-HEP Training, Education and Outreach coordinator (and UPRM physics professor) Sudhir Malik.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">NSF funds IRIS-HEP project to address the massive data demands from the upgraded Large Hadron Collider</title><link href="http://iris-hep.org/2018/09/04/iris-hep-project-funded.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="NSF funds IRIS-HEP project to address the massive data demands from the upgraded Large Hadron Collider" /><published>2018-09-04T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-09-04T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://iris-hep.org/2018/09/04/iris-hep-project-funded</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://iris-hep.org/2018/09/04/iris-hep-project-funded.html">&lt;p&gt;The National Science Foundation (NSF) has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=296456&amp;amp;org=NSF&amp;amp;from=news&quot;&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; the Institute
for Research and Innovation in Software for High-Energy Physics
(IRIS-HEP), a $25 million effort to tackle the unprecedented torrent
of data that will come from the High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider
(HL-LHC), the world’s most powerful particle accelerator. 
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IRIS-HEP will address key elements of the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.06982&quot;&gt;“Roadmap for HEP Software and Computing R&amp;amp;D for the 2020s”&lt;/a&gt;
and will implement the &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.06592&quot;&gt;“Strategic Plan for a Scientific Software
Innovation Institute (S2I2) for High Energy Physics”&lt;/a&gt;
submitted to the NSF in December 2017.
These two documents represent, respectively, the outcome of international 
and U.S. HEP community planning processes; these were driven in part
by the NSF-funded &lt;a href=&quot;http://s2i2-hep.org&quot;&gt;S2I2-HEP Institute Conceptualization Project&lt;/a&gt;.
Over the course of a dozen workshops during 2016 and 2017, more than 260
scientists and engineers from around the world were involved in building this community vision.&lt;/p&gt;
